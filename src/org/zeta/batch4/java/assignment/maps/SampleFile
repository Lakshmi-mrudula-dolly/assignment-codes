On a hot summer day, a thirsty crow could not find water to drink.
He finally spotted a pitcher in a garden, but when he tried to drink, he found the water level was too low for him to reach.
The clever crow, unwilling to give up, saw some pebbles nearby. He had an idea: he picked up a pebble and dropped it into the pitcher, which caused the water level to rise slightly.
He continued this process, dropping more and more pebbles, until the water was high enough for him to quench his thirst.
