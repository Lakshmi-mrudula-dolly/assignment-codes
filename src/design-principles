DRY- don't repeat yourself
YAGNI - You Ain't gonna need it
KISS - keep it simple,stupid


Break logic into reusable modules
1. Use classes & methods efficiently
 * Encapsulate related logic within the class
 * create small focused method that performs one single task
 * reuse methods across different parts of code
2. Follow SRP- Single Responsibility Principle
   * Each class should have one responsibility
3. Use Interfaces & Abstract Classes
   * define interfaces for common behaviour
